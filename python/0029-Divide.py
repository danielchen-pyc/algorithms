'''
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication,
division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional
part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.

Note:

Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within
the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For this problem, assume that
your function returns 231 âˆ’ 1 when the division result overflows.

    a, b, res = abs(dividend), abs(divisor), 0
    for x in range(32)[::-1]:
        if (a >> x) - b >= 0:
            res += 1 << x
            a -= b << x
    return res if (dividend > 0) == (divisor > 0) else -res
